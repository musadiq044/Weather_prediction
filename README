# Weather Condition Predictor

This is a simple web application built with Streamlit to predict weather conditions based on user input parameters.

## Features
- User inputs temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- Predicts weather conditions such as "Hot and Dry," "Cold and Rainy," "Pleasant," "Stormy," or "Low Pressure: Possible Rain."
- Displays the entered parameters along with the predicted condition.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then install the required package:

```sh
pip install streamlit
```

## Running the Application
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
streamlit run stream.py
```

## Usage
1. Enter values for Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (km/h), and Pressure (hPa).
2. Click on the "Predict Weather Condition" button.
3. The predicted weather condition will be displayed along with the input values.

## File Overview
- `stream.py`: The main script that contains the Streamlit app.

## Example Screenshot
After running the application, the interface will look something like this:
